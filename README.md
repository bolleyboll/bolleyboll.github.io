I am Aman Gupta, a Software Engineer from India.

The portfolio in front of you represents who I amâ€”an energetic, creative individual who enjoys learning about new technologies and the ways it can be used to help people work more effectively.

As a developer, and even in my day-to-day life, I strive for efficiency. But, in the reality of today's online world, being fast and responsive just doesn't cut it. Being effective today requires a keen balance between optimization and aesthetics.

My interest in the space began in my early middle school years, during which I was in awe over the endless potential of the field as a whole, but as I stuck with it, my love for the space grew - and I know now that it is where I belong.

Other than programming, over the years, I've also come to love cooking, fitness, and fashion.
